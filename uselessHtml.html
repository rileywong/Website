                Hi! I am a senior studying Computer Science at Stony Brook University and will be graduating May 2018. This is my personal
                website where I showcase anything I'm working on. I am interested in coding, learning, going to concerts
                and living life. You can find a few of my projects, my resume and everything inbetween. Enjoy!
